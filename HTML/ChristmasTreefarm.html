					Taylor Swift released her seventh studio album, Lover, on August 23, 2019, to critical and commercial success.<br>
					Inspired by the holiday season of 2019, "Christmas Tree Farm" was written, recorded, and released by Swift in under six days.<br>
					She wrote the song during Thanksgiving weekend, and recorded it on December 1, 2019, the Sunday before its release, with English producer Jimmy Napes at London Lane Studios, United Kingdom.<br>
					The day after that, a group of choral singers provided the finishing touches.<br>
					The song was announced on Good Morning America on December 5, 2019, and released at midnight the same day, along with an accompanying music video made from home videos<br>
